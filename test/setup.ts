/**
 * Vitest setup file for unit tests.
 *
 * This file runs before all tests and can be used to set up the testing environment.
 *
 * Note:
 * - The vi global is only available when running with Vitest.
 * - Mock reset and mock restoration are configured in vitest.config.unit.ts
 *   via mockReset: true and restoreMocks: true, not in this setup file.
 *
 * Add any additional global test setup logic here if needed in the future.
